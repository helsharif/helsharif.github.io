I generally like the styling of the portfolio website now, but I want to modify the following.

# Left Sidebar Area
Where the headshot is, I want the headshot to be in a circle frame, not rectangular. With sizing of 250px x 250px with slight shading around the image.

The name should be Husayn El Sharif, not Husayn El-Sharif.

email is: helsharif@gmail.com

phone is: +1 (561) 247-1430

Remove birthday section

Location is Marietta, Georgia USA.

# Main content area

## Headline (call this the About Me section)
Should start with my headline: "Georgia Tech Ph.D. and Data Scientist with 8+ years applying machine learning, geospatial analytics, and statistical modeling to extract actionable insights from large, complex data."

## Skills
Then a skills section should appear with a table similar to my resume as follows:
Programming & Analytics: Python, SQL, R, MATLAB, Git, JupyterLab 
Machine Learning & Data: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PySpark
AI Techniques: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Transfer Learning
GenAI & LLM: NLP, Prompt Engineering & Fine-Tuning, RAG, Vector Embeddings, LangChain, CrewAI
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau
Cloud Platforms & MLOps: AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, Snowflake, MLflow, Docker, Streamlit, Hugging Face
Geospatial Analysis: ArcGIS, QGIS, GeoPandas, Google Earth Engine

## Portfolio / Projects
I would like a "Portfolio / Projects" section that is a 3x3 grid of projects from my portfolio. My portfolio currently has the following 7 projects:

Remote Sensing & ML for Water Quality Assessment at Lake Lanier 
Climate-Informed Crop Yield & Irrigation Projections for the ACF River Basin 
Continental-Scale Climate Bias-Correction, Projection, & Interactive Dashboard 
Customer Churn Modeling & Retention Optimization with SparkML, MLflow, & Neural Networks 
AI-Automated Lead Generation Pipeline for Engineering Consultancy (RAG + Web Data) 
AI-Powered Retinal Disease Detection with Deep Learning & Computer Vision Pipeline 
Multi-Agent GenAI System for Automated Hydrology Literature Review (CrewAI + LLMs)

For each project I would like it to have a spot in the grid. Each grid would have a rounded rectangular clickable showcase image, a caption, a brief one sentence summary, and some keywords. For now use placeholders for portfolio showcase images. Clicking on a project should lead to a dedicated page for that project which I will prepare later.

## Professional Experience
Put the professional experience here and copy the content from my resume.

## Education
Put the education here and copy the content from my resume

## Contact
Place a contact box here that people can send me an email.

## Other modifications
I don't want a blog section.
The navigation links should be About, Portfolio, Professional Experience, Contact and should link to sections of this page.
