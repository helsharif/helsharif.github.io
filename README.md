# Hi, I'm Husayn El Sharif 👋  
### Senior Data Scientist • Machine Learning Engineer • Georgia Tech Ph.D.

Hi, I’m **Husayn**. I’m a **Senior Data Scientist** and **Georgia Tech Ph.D.** with over ten years of experience working with machine learning, geospatial analytics, and complex real world data. I enjoy taking messy information and turning it into insights that **help people make better decisions**.

My work spans remote sensing, environmental analytics, and applied AI, backed by **models, pipelines, and dashboards** I’ve built for researchers, engineers, and operational teams. I also mentor students and early career professionals who are developing their skills in data science and programming.

Grounded in civil engineering and hydrology, I bring a practical way of understanding complex systems, and that foundation still shapes how I approach data and problem solving. I now apply these skills across a wider range of fields where careful analysis can support meaningful, evidence based improvements in **science, technology, and public health**.
