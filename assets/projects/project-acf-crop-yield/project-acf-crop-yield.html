                        This project integrated soil, crop, and meteorological datasets with the DSSAT Cropping System
                        Model
                        (DSSAT-CSM) to assess how climate will reshape agricultural production and irrigation demand
                        across
                        the Apalachicola–Chattahoochee–Flint (ACF) River Basin. The analysis focused on four major
                        crops—
                        peanuts, corn, soybeans, and cotton—and examined yield sensitivity across normal, dry, and wet
                        years. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

                        A Joint Variable Bias Correction (JVBC) algorithm was applied to CMIP6 climate projections,
                        producing
                        high-resolution, bias-corrected temperature and precipitation fields suitable for driving DSSAT
                        and
                        downstream regression models. These climate-informed projections were then used to estimate
                        future
                        crop yields and irrigation demand through the end of the century, providing decision-makers with
                        actionable evidence for drought management and water-resources planning.

                    <p>
                        The ACF River Basin is an agricultural and hydrologic “hotspot,” where irrigation, municipal
                        demand, ecosystem needs, and interstate water-sharing agreements intersect. Shifts in
                        growing-season
                        rainfall and evaporative demand directly affect crop yields and the volume and timing of
                        irrigation
                        withdrawals.

                    <p>
                        Historically, growers and water managers relied on station-based climate records and
                        rule-of-thumb irrigation scheduling. However, with intensifying heat, altered precipitation
                        patterns, and more frequent agricultural droughts, this approach is no longer sufficient to plan
                        for the next several decades. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

                        evapotranspiration
                        shape crop yields and irrigation demand in the ACF River Basin, and how can this information be
                        used
                        to guide more resilient farm and water-management strategies?
