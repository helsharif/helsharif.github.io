                        This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications provider serving more
                        than
                        7,000 home phone and internet customers. The goal is to flag high-risk customers early and give
                        the
                        business enough lead time to intervene with targeted retention offers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I built a baseline Logistic Regression model to provide interpretable churn probabilities, then
                        extended the work with a multi-layer neural network in TensorFlow and a scalable SparkML +
                        MLflow pipeline in Databricks. Together, these implementations demonstrate how to move from
                        exploratory churn analysis to production-ready modeling and experiment tracking.

                <div class="project-section-text">
                    <p>
                        In subscription businesses like telecom, retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective
                        than
                        acquiring new ones. However, churn drivers are often complex, spanning pricing, service quality,
                        contract terms, and customer demographics. Without data-driven insight, retention programs can
                        be
                        scattered and inefficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The telco dataset used in this project includes customer demographics (age, dependents,
                        partner),
                        service details (phone, internet, streaming, technical support), contract and billing
                        information
                        (month-to-month vs. annual, paperless billing, payment method), and a churn label indicating
                        whether each customer left within the past month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> How can we use modern machine learning techniques to predict
                        which
                        telecom customers are most likely to churn, and translate those predictions into actionable
                        retention strategies that prioritize high-value, high-risk segments?

                        The modeling workflow combined careful data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and multiple ML
                        approaches—including Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and a SparkML production pipeline.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Data Understanding:</strong> The dataset captured demographic and service attributes
                            such as gender, senior citizen status, dependents, tenure, phone and internet service,
                            streaming and tech-support options, contract length, payment method, monthly charges, and

                        <li>
                            <strong>Exploratory Findings:</strong> Early analysis revealed that many customers who churn
                            do so within their first month of service, and that churn risk is substantially higher for
                            customers paying $70–$110 per month on month-to-month contracts compared with lower-paying
                            or
                            longer-term customers.

                            <strong>Preprocessing &amp; Feature Engineering:</strong> Categorical variables were
                            encoded into numeric form, continuous variables were cleaned and standardized as needed, and
                            the data was shuffled and split into 80% training and 20% testing sets with stratification
                            by
                            churn label to preserve class proportions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Class Imbalance Handling:</strong> Because churners form a minority class, both
                            resampling techniques (SMOTE) and probability-threshold tuning strategies were evaluated to
                            improve recall on the churn class while controlling false positives.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Logistic Regression (Baseline):</strong> A Logistic Regression model was trained to
                            estimate churn probabilities and provide interpretable coefficients for each feature. On the
                            held-out test set, the model achieved an overall accuracy of around 77%, with strong
                            performance on both churn and non-churn classes (e.g., churn F1 score in the low 0.60s,
                            non-churn F1 in the mid 0.80s).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Neural Network (TensorFlow):</strong> A feedforward neural network with one input
                            layer, three hidden layers, and a sigmoid output was trained on the same feature set. The
                            neural net achieved slightly higher overall accuracy (~79%) and marginal improvements in
                            macro F1, demonstrating that both interpretable linear models and deeper architectures can
                            effectively capture churn patterns.

                            <strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Customer records were stored as a managed Databricks table,
                            with Spark handling distributed loading and preprocessing across the cluster.

                            <strong>SparkML Pipeline:</strong> A Logistic Regression model was implemented as a SparkML
                            pipeline, including feature indexing/encoding, vector assembly, and model training—mirroring
                            the structure of the earlier Python/scikit-learn implementation but at production scale.

                            <strong>MLflow Experiment Tracking:</strong> MLflow was used to track experiments,
                            hyperparameters,
                            metrics, and model artifacts, enabling side-by-side comparison of different feature
                            configurations, regularization strengths, and decision thresholds.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Threshold Optimization:</strong> To address class imbalance, the default 0.5
                            decision
                            threshold was tuned toward the baseline churn rate (~26%). This improved churn recall from
                            roughly 50% to about 78%, giving the business greater visibility into at-risk customers at
                            the
                            cost of a controlled increase in false positives.

                            precision–recall trade-offs, ROC curves, and churn-risk distribution across customer

                        The combined modeling and deployment workflow delivers not just predictions, but concrete levers
                        for improving retention strategy and marketing efficiency.

                            <strong>Targeted Retention Offers:</strong> Model results show that customers on
                            month-to-month contracts with monthly charges above ~$70 are significantly more likely to
                            churn.
                            These customers become prime candidates for introductory discounts, bundled services, or
                            incentives to switch to longer-term contracts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Early-Lifecycle Interventions:</strong> Many churn events occur during the first
                            month
                            of service, suggesting the need for stronger onboarding, proactive support, and early
                            feedback
                            loops for new customers.

                            <strong>Explainable Drivers of Churn:</strong> Logistic Regression provides interpretable
                            coefficients, clearly linking churn risk to attributes like contract length, tenure, and
                            billing
                            method. These insights can be shared directly with marketing and customer-success teams.

                            <strong>Scalable MLOps Template:</strong> The Databricks + SparkML + MLflow implementation
                            serves as a reusable template for other subscription-based businesses, enabling them to plug
                            in
                            their own customer tables, retrain, and monitor churn models in a production environment.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Balanced Performance:</strong> By carefully tuning class imbalance handling and
                            decision thresholds, the models strike a practical balance between catching at-risk
                            customers
                            and minimizing unnecessary retention spend.
