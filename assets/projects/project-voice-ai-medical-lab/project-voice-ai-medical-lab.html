                        This project developed a <strong>production-ready voice AI customer-service agent</strong> for
                        <strong>Access Medical Labs</strong>, a large diagnostic testing facility offering bloodwork,
                        COVID-19 testing, hormone panels, and wellness screening services. The AI agent
                        functioned as a virtual receptionist, handling fully automated telephone interactions
                        including appointment booking, rescheduling, cancellation, frequently asked questions,
                        and call routing.

                    <p>
                        The agent combined conversational intelligence with strict operational rules, enabling
                        it to manage real appointment workflows and patient questions while maintaining a
                        professional and medically appropriate tone. The system demonstrates end to end applied AI
                        development, including knowledge base construction, structured prompt design, workflow
                        orchestration, evaluation of model behavior, and integration of language models with real
                        operational systems.

                    <p>
                        Medical laboratories receive a high volume of routine calls related to appointment scheduling,
                        rescheduling, cancellations, and basic questions about tests, hours, and location. These calls
                        are time consuming for front-desk staff and often occur outside peak staffing windows. At the
                        same time, lab interactions must respect privacy constraints and maintain a clear, professional
                        tone for patients who may already be stressed or anxious about testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> How can a voice AI system be designed to reliably automate
                        medical-lab customer service tasks while respecting operational constraints, HIPAA sensitive
                        interactions, and natural conversational flow, with the objective of reducing staff workload and
                        improving patient access to scheduling and information?

                        The voice agent was developed using the <strong>Retell AI</strong> platform, which provides real time speech
                        recognition, synthesized voice output, and low latency language model inference for phone calls.
                        The agent’s behavior was governed by a structured system prompt and a multi-part workflow
                        that controlled turn taking, question sequencing, error recovery, and escalation.

                            Maintained a friendly, concise, and medically professional tone while ensuring the agent
                            asked only one question at a time.

                        <li>
                            Supported HIPAA conscious logic, such as never revealing test results and escalating

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Enforced deterministic flow control:
                            greet caller, classify intent, verify name and test type, and then follow
                            appointment booking, rescheduling, or cancellation logic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Imposed clarity rules for reading numbers, lists, explanatory parentheses, and content after
                            colons to improve the intelligibility of synthesized speech.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This prompt architecture combined natural language reasoning with deterministic decision graphs,
                        creating a controlled inference environment that <strong>minimized hallucinations</strong> and <strong>enforced
                        reproducible behavior</strong> across callers. The design explicitly prevented over generation, managed
                        ambiguous utterances, and restricted outputs to approved knowledge sources.
                    </p>

                    <h3>API Integration with n8n &amp; Cal.com</h3>
                    <p>
                        To operationalize scheduling tasks, the agent integrated with n8n workflows and the Cal.com
                        scheduling API.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="project-bullets">
                        <li>
                            n8n served as an orchestration layer for call metadata, request validation, and webhook
                            handling.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cal.com API calls handled appointment availability lookup, booking with dynamic slot
                            selection, and cancellation and rescheduling workflows.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The agent collected and validated required patient information, invoked the appropriate
                            Cal.com endpoint, confirmed success or failure to the caller, and escalated to human staff
                            when logic branches exceeded complexity thresholds.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Hybrid Reasoning &amp; Control</h3>
                    <p>
                        From a modeling perspective, the system used the language model for intent recognition, natural
                        language understanding, and response generation, while deterministic policies enforced
                        state transitions for appointment flows, privacy handling, and human escalation. This hybrid
                        design ensured that the agent remained both <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>predictable</strong> across a wide range of
                        caller behaviors.

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a proof of concept, the system demonstrated that a fully automated voice agent can manage
                        medical lab scheduling tasks and routine inquiries with reliability and professionalism.
                        Key outcomes included:
